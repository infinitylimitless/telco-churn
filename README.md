# telco-churn
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of churn rates at a telco company. The goal is to build a predictive model to assess the likelihood of customer churn, improving the company's ability to retain its customer base.  *The above has been generated using Notionâ€™s AI writing function and has been proofread by me.*
