This project involves an exploratory data analysis of churn rates at a telecommunications company, utilizing the R programming language. The analysis aims to identify key characteristics and behaviors of customers who end their services. Various statistical techniques, such as crosstabs, chi-square tests, and logistic regression, are employed to examine and interpret the data. The project also includes a deep dive into different customer demographics, contract types, and reasons for churn. The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model to assess the likelihood of customer churn, improving the company's ability to retain its customer base.
